## Overview
The **Brostά Interframework** is a revolutionary multilingual interframework designed for modern applications, seamlessly integrating an administration panel, operating system, and smart home functionalities. Crafted with stringent specifications inspired by spacecraft technology, this advanced interframework focuses on hybrid parallel multitasking, allowing support for multiple multitasking methods, including pre-emptive and cooperative multitasking, to enhance efficiency and performance.

## Spacecraft-Inspired Design
The design philosophy of the Brostά Interframework draws inspiration from the aerospace industry, where systems must operate reliably and efficiently in extreme conditions. This focus translates into real-world benefits that enhance its applicability across diverse sectors:

### Reliability
Spacecraft systems necessitate extremely high reliability. The Brostά Interframework inherits this emphasis, making it suitable for mission-critical applications where failure is not an option. Applications built on this interframework can operate under high-stakes conditions without risk of failure.

### Efficiency
With limited resources in space, the Brostά Interframework is crafted to maximize efficiency. It minimizes resource consumption while optimizing performance, leading to significant cost savings and improved speed in various applications.

### Real-time Capabilities
Real-time processing is crucial for tasks such as navigation and control in spacecraft. The Brostά Interframework supports real-time operations, making it ideal for applications that require immediate responses. This capability is essential in industries where timing is critical, ensuring tasks are executed precisely when needed.

### Remote Management
The Brostά Interframework features a Cockpit panel that facilitates remote management of devices and systems. This functionality allows users to manage various applications, including spacecraft functions, enhancing its utility in remote monitoring and control scenarios.

## Key Features
- **Hybrid Parallel Multitasking:** Combines pre-emptive and cooperative multitasking methods for efficient task scheduling and execution across multiple cores, allowing for responsive and adaptive application behavior.
- **Multilingual Support:** Utilizes JavaScript, PHP, and C, offering flexibility in application development.
- **Administration Panel (Cockpit):** A user-friendly interface enabling effective management of Brostά applications, providing a central point for control and configuration.
- **Operating System (Brostά OS):** A lightweight and efficient operating system specifically designed for Brostά applications, enhancing performance and resource management.
- **Smart Home Panel:** Effortlessly control and monitor smart home devices, providing users with a comprehensive home automation experience.
- **Flexible Architecture:** Built for scalability and customization, enabling seamless integration with various smart home technologies.

- **Real Machine Management via Cockpit:** Manage real machines such as PLCs, sensors, and even spacecraft functions through the intuitive Cockpit Panel.

## User Configurable Settings
To maintain smooth operation while allowing user customization, the following settings can be adjusted:

### General Configuration
- **BRO_NANOSECONDS_IN_SECOND:** Sets the number of nanoseconds in a second (set to `1000000000ULL`), essential for precise timing calculations.

### Calibration and Smoothing
- **v_tasks_per_second:** Monitors the current tasks-per-second performance, dynamically updated during runtime.
- **v_calibration_loops:** Adjusts the number of loops used in each calibration cycle based on task execution time.
- **v_threshold_variance:** Sets the threshold for acceptable timing variance in task execution.
- **v_optimal_delay_us:** Specifies the optimal delay between tasks in microseconds.
- **adaptive_smoothing:** A boolean to enable or disable adaptive smoothing for task timing adjustments.

### Batch and Task Limits
- **MAX_BATCH_LIMIT:** Maximum number of task batches allowed in the system.
- **MAX_TASKS_PER_BATCH:** Limits the number of tasks processed within a single batch.


### Runtime Configurable Constants
- **BATCH_LIMIT:** Adjusts the number of batches processed at runtime.
- **TIME_QUANTUM:** Sets the time (in microseconds) between cycles in the task execution loop.
